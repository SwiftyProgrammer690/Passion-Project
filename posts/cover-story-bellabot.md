So, Robots have come to the point where they are stealing manual and *expressive* jobs such as a restuaraunt waiter. The robot, "*BellaBot*" made by [Pudu](https://www.pudurobotics.com/product/detail/bellabot)

BellaBot is a robot waiter that can take orders, give back orders, clean dirty dishes, and even do cheques! It's also a pretty cute cat robot if you ask me...

Bellabot was made for restaraunts that specialize in asian foods such as dumplings. Accoring to [CNN10's video](https://www.cnn.com/videos/cnn10/2022/10/19/ten-1020orig.cnn), BellaBot can hold up to 38 bamboo steamers compared to a professianal waiter's 12 bamboo steamers. In a competition that CNN10 held that was BellaBot vs. a professional **human** waiter (8 years of experience), the human won 3 - 1. But in 10 years, things might be changed.

Robots and AI are constantly improved with the time progressing. According to [The Motley Fool's post](https://www.fool.com/research/which-jobs-automated-10-years/), it states that, "*The government agency reasons that automation or other efficiency gains through technology will contribute to employment declines in 19 out of the 30 occupations it estimates will have the largest decline in employment over the next decade.*", that is equivalent to "*a decrease about the size of Atlanta's population*".

That sums up todays cover story! Read more of the presentation on how to secure a career! And, keep ***your*** job safe!
