So, Robots have come to the point where they are stealing jobs as well as "the arts"! One of these robots that have been going for a long time is AlphaZero made by DeepMind also made by Google!

AlphaZero is a chess robot that has beaten one of the best chess robots out there, [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/), and that to in **4 hours**! So, you might be wondering, how did Alphazero do this??? Let's get into that!

According to [Deepmind's blogpost](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go), DeepMind has done the impressive feat of beating one of the greatest chess engine "Stockfish" in 4 hours by playing itself over and over and over!

Here are some data analytics provided by DeepMind:

You may have saw some other bots and that's because Alphazero did not only teach itself chess in 4 hours, it taught itself shogi and go along with chess.

The scary part about this is that other robots like this one exists and if we don't put a limit on what AI can do, we are probably going to *doom* ourselves.

That sums up todays cover story! Read more of the presentation on how to secure a career! And, keep ***your*** job safe!
